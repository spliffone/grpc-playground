# GRPC Playground

Play with several GRPC features.

## Prepare Environment

Before playing with GRPC it is necessary to install the `protoc` compiler.

Follow the instructions in [Compiling your protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/gotutorial#compiling-your-protocol-buffers), or just call:

```bash
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
```
